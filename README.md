## User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
* As a First Time user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.
* As a First Time user, I want to easily play the game and expect a score tracking system.

### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning user, I want to play the game and have some fun time.

## Design

### Wireframes



### Colour Scheme

* Three main colours used:
  * Dark Blue #36486b, used for game background and header backgorund.
  * White #ffffff for body where more contrast with the dark blue was needed.
  * Light Blue shade #bccad6 for the general background. 
 
 The Dark Blue and White shades should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes.

I chose a default Black color for the body in the instructions page as more contrast was needed with the light blue shade.

User score is colored with Green, Computer score is colored in Red.

The selected icon is highlighted by clicking on it with Green shades #4dcc7d and #30b539 when the user choice is the winning one.
The selected icon is highlighted by clicking on it with Red shades #fc121a and #d01115 when the user choice is the losing one.
The selected icon is highlighted by clicking on it with Yellow shades #e7ed3b and #9fa326 when the user choice is the same as the computer choice.

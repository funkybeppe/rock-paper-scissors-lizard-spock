## Testing

### Summary 

Testing is required on Milestone Project 2 - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Responsive Website.

The testing is performed on the visual effects and layout of the Website, on the functionality of the clickable elements and on the ability for the computer to make a choice and match it with the user choice.

No elements should overlap another container div. All elements should remain on the screen at all sizes above 280px.

All buttons should direct to the correct HTML pages.

The live Project can be found [here](https://funkybeppe.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/index.html)

### Tests Performed

* Test responsiveness of website on all screen sizes on chrome browser
* Test responsiveness of website on all screen sizes on safari browser
* Test responsiveness of website on all screen sizes on firefox browser
* Validate navigation items navigate to the correct pages
* Validate hover color change on buttons
* Validate color change on images after choice
* Validate media content works
* Validate clickable elements function correctly
* Validate computer choice
* Validate message display changes after choice
* Validate score update after outcome match
* Validate end screen functionality

### Tests Results

## Bugs

* As images are used to represent the choices and not buttons, I could not figure out how to disable them at the end of the game when the maximum score was reached, allowing the player to keep clicking on the images.
I have soon found out it was better to create an end screen page that partially covered the content, blocking any interaction with the images.

## Validator Testing

* HTML

  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

* CSS

  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C CSS validator.

* JS 

  * No errors were returned when passing through JShint validator.
  * Warnings were sometimes present with regard to missing semicolons, however these have been rectified.
  * Warnings are currently present, however these are regarding ES6 Compatibility; I'm aware of these and I am satisfied these can be dismissed.
  
* Accessibility

  * I confirmed that the colors and fonts are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
